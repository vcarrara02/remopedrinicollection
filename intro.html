  <h2> Introduction: Remo Pedrini <br>
  <small>(from Giovanni Finazzi's biography in Pedrini, 1988)</small></h2>

    <p> Remo Pedrini was born on June 7th, 1930. He lived in Scanzorosciate (Bergamo) his whole life, where he worked as a barber to follow the family tradition. <br>
The first poem he ever wrote was for his girlfriend (whom he later married) while he was serving in the army in 1952.<br>
Abele Ruggeri, a poet from Ranica, a city not too far from where Pedrini lived, came across this poem almost randomly and was impressed, so much so that he became Pedrini's master and helped him getting started with his first "serious" poems in 1977.<br>
Throughout the years, Pedrini took part in many poetry contests, that earned him various awards, including the "Gromo Penna d'oro" award in 1987. <br>
The collection of poetry <i>La Scagna del Barbér</i> is the only work he published before passing away.</p>
  
    <p> Despite not being very well known, Pedrini's poetry represents an important work in dialectal poetry, as he studied the Bergamasco dialect thoroughly while he was writing the poems. <br>
His language does not display distinctive features of the Bergamasco from his area (the foothills of the Orobic Alps). According to Finazzi, his intent was to create poetry that would be easily accessible to every person that speaks Bergamasco.</p>

  <h2> Introduction: Bergamasco history</h2> 
  
    <p> The Bergamasque dialect represents a dialectal variety belonging to the Eastern Lombard branch of the Gallo-Romance languages.<br> 
It is spoken in the area of the city and province of Bergamo, in the Crema region, and in the Lecco area of the San Martino Valley.<br>
The origins of the dialect seem to date back to before the year 1000. This is evidenced by the documents collected by Mario Lupo and Antonio Tiraboschi to compile, respectively, the <i>Codex diplomaticus civitatis, et ecclesiae bergomatis</i> (1784) and the <i>Glossario Bergamasco Medioevale</i>.
Numerous scholars, both in the past and more recently, have argued that Bergamasco underwent few changes from its earliest attestations up to the 15th century.<br> 
Nevertheless, the language used in the earliest texts was likely not the popular, everyday Bergamasque, but rather a form shaped by those who, aided by their knowledge of notarial Latin and the speech of educated Lombards, sought to be understood even by non-Bergamasque speakers.</p>

    <p> While in the 15th century the documents written in Bergamasco are mostly of a poetic and religious nature, by the early 16th century, the dialect begins to appear in a wider variety of writings (short stories, chapters and sermons, sonnets, songs, translations, and adaptations of chivalric poems), even surpassing Milanese in terms of literary production.<br
However, it should be noted that the language used in compositions and comedies during the 16th and 17th centuries reflects the rustic vernacular spoken in one of the valleys surrounding the city (specifically, the Brembana Valley) rather than the dialect of the city of Bergamo itself.<br>
In the 17th century in particular, the rediscovery of dialect and local literatures leads to a broader use of Bergamasque—not only in translations of works (notably: Tasso’s <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i> by Carlo Assonica; Ovid’s <i>Metamorphoses</i> translated into Bergamasco by the Brescian Colombano Brescianini), but also in original compositions and comedies written by non-Bergamasque authors, who begin to portray characters speaking various local dialects.</p>

    <p> The debate between language and dialect becomes central throughout Italy during the 18th century.<br> 
In Bergamo, this period sees the creation of the first dialect dictionary, titled <i>Vocabolario bergamasco latino italiano</i>, by the Bergamasque priest G. Battista Angelini.<br> 
His work, begun around 1740, was completed at the end of May 1808 thanks to the efforts of Canon Antonio Maria Ambiveri.Lexicographical production becomes especially important during the period of Italian Unification, when the issue of an Italian vocabulary once again takes center stage.<br>
Within this context, Antonio Tiraboschi emerged and developed.<br>
Born in Alzano Maggiore on July 31, 1838, to parents originally from Serina, he became one of the leading scholars and erudite figures of the second half of the 19th century. He was deeply engaged in historical-linguistic, literary, and cultural studies related to Bergamo.<br> 
His dedication to study and research, further supported by his appointment in 1877 as librarian of the Angelo Mai Civic Library, is well documented through a series of linguistic works, such as <i>Parre e il gergo dei suoi pastori</i> (1864, later revised as <i>Il gergo dei pastori bergamaschi</i>, 1878), his writings on <i>Proverbi Bergamaschi</i> (1875), the <i>Abbozzo di grammatica italiana-bergamasca</i> (1880), and the collection of Bergamasque documents and texts from the 13th to the 19th Century.</p>

  <h3> Famous Bergamasque poets</h3>  
   
    <p> Throughout the years, there has been quite a few poetry authors who used Bergamasco as their language of choice.<br>
Some of them include:
