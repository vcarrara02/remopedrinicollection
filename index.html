    <h1>Welcome to the Remo Pedrini Collection</h1>

    <p>This website offers a selection of poems from Remo Pedrini's work <i> La Scagna del Barbér </i>, in order to offer an exegetical resource of poetry in Bergamasco for academics and dialectal poetry enthusiasts. The translation of the poems is provided by Valentina Carrara, with the aid of Francia and Gambarini's Dictionary of Bergamasco. </p>

    <p>The structure of the site includes an introduction to the poet and the Bergamasco dialectal variety, four sections corresponding to the ones in the book, and a notes section for additional context and commentary.</p>

    <p>Key terms and significant phrases throughout the text are marked as hyperlinks. These links connect directly to the relevant notes, enabling quick and effective navigation for enhanced understanding and ease of reference. <br> 
    The notes serve as a way to further understand not only the linguistic aspect of the texts, but also cultural references specific to the area where Bergamasco is spoken.</p>
