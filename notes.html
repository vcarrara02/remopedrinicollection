<p>To fully grasp the content of Pedrini's poetry, it is important to note some cultural references and some interesting expressions that are present in the texts.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>I - CANTADE</h2>
<div id="note1" class="note"><b>Note 1</b> The <i>back of a hill</i> Pedrini is referencing is not a single relief, but the seven hills (<i>colli</i> in Italian) on which the historical part of the city (<i>Sità Ólta</i>, or <i>Città Alta</i> in Italian) was built: <i>Colle di Gromo, Colle di San Salvatore, Colle Aperto, Colle di Rosate, Colle di S. Eufemia, Colle di San Michele al Pozzo Bianco, Colle di San Giovanni</i>.<br>
	  Reference:<a href="https://www.visitbergamo.net/en/oggetto/citta-alta/">visitbergamo.net</a></div>
<div id="note2" class="note"><b>Note 2</b> The town square is <i>Piassa Ègia</i> (<i>Piazza Vecchia</i> in Italian, ie. <i>Old Square</i>), the main square of the historical part of the city.<br>
	Originally a Roman forum, the square was renovated in the XV century, when all the current buildings were designed and the square was connected to <i>piazza Duomo</i>, making the area the most important monumental centre of Bergamo.<br>

<div id="note3" class="note"><b>Note 3</b> The walls of <i>Sità Ólta</i> were erected by the Republic of Venice in the XVI century and have become a UNESCO-listed treasure in 2017.<br>
	<a href="https://thevenetianfortresses.com/en/unesco/bergamo/?_gl=1*kyjp4i*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTAwMjU5OTYxNy4xNzUyMjQ2NzA0*_ga_XFYW7LZCPG*czE3NTIyNDY3MDQkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTIyNDY3MjckajM3JGwwJGgw">Footage of the fortress walls</a></div>
<div id="note4" class="note"><b>Note 4</b> <i>Sità Bassa</i> refers to the lower, more recent part of the city of Bergamo. It originated from the development of 8 boroughs: <i>Borgo Canale, Borgo Sant'Alessandro, Borgo San Leonardo, Borgo Pignolo, Borgo San Tomaso, Borgo Santa Caterina, Borgo Sant'Antonio e Borgo Palazzo.</i><br>
	<img src="portanuova.jpg" alt="Piazza Vecchia" /><br>
	<i>Porta Nuova</i>, the central parte of the lower city (image from <a href="https://www.visitbergamo.net/oggetto/porta-nuova/">visitbergamo.net</a>).</div>
<div id="note5" class="note"><b>Note 5</b><i> Ü soch che 'l a düsit röscàla</i> is an idiomatic expression. <i>Sòch</i> means "tree stump", while <i>rösca</i> can be translated into "peel/bark".<br>
	The verse is a metaphor that refers to the proverbial hard-wroking nature of the people from Bergamo.</div>
<div id="note6" class="note"><b>Note 6</b> The spelling <i>l'</i> is a poetic license that would not be considered standard by scholars (see Sanga, 1984): since the complete word would be <i>al</i> the apostrophe should be before, not after the <i>l</i>.</div>
<div id="note7" class="note"><b>Note 7</b> The adjective <i>bergamasch</i> was intentionally left in the translation to emphasise the poet's pride in his origins.<br>
It must also be noted that English does not have a proper trasnlation for the adjcetive, however using a longer structure would have been needed(eg. "being from Bergamo") would have disrupted too much the structure of the poem.</div>
<div id="note8" class="note"><b>Note 8</b> "Gioanì" is a loving nickname that refers to Pope John XXIII (born Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, 1881- 1963).<br>
	John XXIII was born in Sotto il Monte, a small village in the Bergamo province, in a humble family of sharecroppers. After serving in the medical corps during World War I, he traveled for the Vatican in Bulgaria, Türkiye and Greece and became a cardinal in 1953, when he was appointed Patriarch of Venice.<br>
	Following the death of Pope Pius XII, he was coronated Pope on 4 November 1958.<br>

	Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_XXIII">Wikipedia</a></div>
<div id="note9" class="note"><b>Note 9</b> Pope John XXIII was benevolently known as "The Good Pope" due to his will to reconcile the Vatican with the Orthodox Church, and also due to his role in some of the major conflict of the second half of the XX century (namely the Cold War and the Cuba crisis), where he urged world politicans to keep the peace.<br>
	He also opened the Second Vatican Council in order to revitalise the Church's relationships with the modern world and foster unity among Christians.<br>
	He is remembered fondly by the Christian community, especially from the people of Bergamo, so much so that his hometown has been renamed as "Sotto il Monte Giovanni XXIII".</div>
<div id="note10" class="note"><b>Note 10</b> This is a case of double clitics that would be normally spelled as <i>al 'l a</i>, as the first clitic does not refer to the subject but to the direct object and therefore cannot be elided with the apostrophe.</div>
</section>


<section>
	<h2>II - LOCIADE</h2>
<div id="note11" class="note"><b>Note 11</b> The poem is an elegy to one of Pedrini's brothers.</div>
<div id="note12" class="note"><b>Note 12</b> The order of phrases in this verse deviates from the standard, in order for <i>presunér</i> to rhyme with <i>pensér</i> from the verse above. Normally it should be "<i>èss presunér d'ü mal che no perduna</i>". </div>
<div id="note13" class="note"><b>Note 13</b> The use of the verb <i>doì/döì</i> ("must") is not frequently employed in contemporary Bergamasco, as the periphrasis <i>ìga dè</i> (lit."have to") is often preferred. </div>
<div id="note14" class="note"><b>Note 14</b> This is another case of poetic use of apostrophes, as the standard spelling for this cluster of pronouns would be <i>te l'è</i>. In this case the aprostrophe is correctly placed after the consonant, as the name the pronoun is referring to is feminine and is therefore <i>la</i>.</div>
<div id="note15" class="note"><b>Note 15</b> The spelling <i>a l'</i> is a poetic license that would not be considered standard by scholars (see Sanga, 1984): the two words both indicate the 3rd person sigular subject of the verb <i>dürerà</i> and should therefore be written as a single word with no apostrophe.</div>
<div id="note16" class="note"><b>Note 16</b> <i>Sgarèla</i> is an old game for children where a stick is used to hit the sharp end of a twig to lift it in the air and then hit it back and throw it as far as possible.</div>
<div id="note17" class="note"><b>Note 17</b> The use of a metaphor related to flowers and their most typical season to describe youth is common in both languages, therefore the translation has been adapted accordingly to the most common English expression used to convey this meaning.</div>
<div id="note18" class="note"><b>Note 18</b> <i>Bòi</i> (lit."beautiful") is a variant of the adjective <i>bèi</i> (base form <i>bèl</i>).</div>
<div id="note19" class="note"><b>Note 19</b> The idiomatic expression can be literally translates into "climbing partners" as a mountain metaphor that conveys the concept of a long lasting friendship. However, since this metaphor is not shared by both languages, the translation focused more on the concept of a past frienship (this also due to the difficulty of translating a metaphor into a description of the former without disrupting the structure of the verse).</div>
<div id="note20" class="note"><b>Note 20</b> The idiomatic expression can be literally translated into "I'm filling the satchel of my years" and has been translated into a metaphor that conveys the same meaning of "time passing by year by year".</div>

	<h2>III - LAÙR E MESTÉR DE ÒM</h2>
<div id="note21" class="note"><b>Note 21</b> Pierina Eugenia Morosini (1931-1957) was a laywoman who has been beatified in 1987 by the Catholic Church.<br>
Morosini lived in Fiòbe (Fiobbio in Italian), a suburb of 'Lbì (Albino in Italian) and was known for being a very pious woman. She joined Azione Cattolica, a lay catholic association, with the hopes of studying the scriptures and helping the ones in need and in 1947 went on a pilgrimage to Rome.<br>
She wanted to become a noun but her relatives needed her to be around to help and support the family, so instead she took vows of chastity, poverty and obedience.<br>
On the 4th of April while she was coming home from the cotton mill she was working at, she was approached by a man who sexually assaulted her. In an attempt to flee she was hit repeatedly with a rock and was then found by her brother and rushed to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead two days later.<br>
The incident shocked the small community and became known as "The Misma crime" after the mountain where it happened. After 37 days of investigation, the killer turned himself to the police and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.<br>
In the years following the case, Morosini's tragic passing became known a story of martyrdom and in 1972 the procedures for her beatification started to took place and were completed by 1987. She continues to be remembered as an important religious figure of the Val Seriana area.<br>

<div id="note22" class="note"><b>Note 22</b> <i>De</i> is a poetic license, the correct preposition would be <i>dela</i>.</div>
<div id="note23" class="note"><b>Note 23</b> Fiòbe (Fiobbio in Italian) is a district of the town of Albino. The district is situated at the foothills of mount Misma in the small valley known as Val del Lujo, tributary of the Seriana Valley.<br>
